			<h3>Create Link</h3>
			<p>To create a new Blogroll Link, go to "New" -&gt; "Blogroll Link" in the menu.
			You create the link just as you would create a normal post. If you expand the "Settings"
			and "XFN Relationship" sliders, you can add additional information about your link.</p>
			
			<p>You can additionally add a "Quick Link", at the top, by entering the URL of your link, and Blogroll
			will attempt to discover information about that URL automatically.</p>
			
			<h3>Manage Blogroll</h3>
			<p>Managing Blogroll Links is done exactly the same as managing standard posts; go to "Manage"
			-&gt; "Blogroll" in the menu. Here you can edit, delete, etc. your Blogroll Links.</p>
			
			<h3>Configure Blogroll</h3>
			<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> if you choose to "Use Weblogs.com to get updates" it can <strong>cause severe
			load on your database</strong>. It is recomend you use this option with caution.</p>

			<p>In the configure screen, You can choose how the Blogroll will be displayed in your theme.</p>

			<h3>Controlling Access</h3>
			<p>You can control who can see your Blogroll links in the same way access can be controlled to other
			content types. Go to the Groups admin page, select a group and you can specify whether the group can
			read, create, edit, and delete Blogroll links. By default, Blogroll will try to add read access for
			users who aren't logged in (the anonymous group).</p>
			
			<h3>Import/Export OPML</h3>
			<p>You can import an OPML file from other applications, such as Liferea, Feed on Feeds, Google Reader, etc.
			Go to "Import" in the menu and select "BlogRoll OPML File" as the type of import to perform. Here you can
			upload or link directly to any OPML file.</p>

			<p>To export your blogroll as OPML, simply navigate to the public URL ${habari_root}/blogroll/opml. You can
			use this link as an export or for things like "Sources" in Liferea.</p>

			<h3>Display Blogroll as a Block</h3>
			<p>To display your Blogroll as a block in one of your theme's areas, create a new "blogroll" block in the "Areas"
			section of the Themes admin page.</p>

			<p>You can change the template it uses for display by copying "templates/block.blogroll.php", in the
			blogroll plugin folder, to your theme's root folder, and modifying that template to your liking.</p>

			<h3>Display Blogroll Manually</h3>
			<p>To display your Blogroll, simply add the following template tag to your theme:</p>
			<pre>&lt;?php $theme->show_blogroll(); ?&gt;</pre>

			<p>You can change the template it uses for display by copying "templates/blogroll.php", in the
			blogroll plugin folder, to your theme's root folder, and modifying that template to your liking. Also
			note that some themes already provide a customized blogroll template.</p>
