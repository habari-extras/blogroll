			<h3>Create Link</h3>
			<p>To create a new Blogroll Link, go to "New" -&gt; "Blogroll Link" in the menu.
			You create the link just as you would create a normal post. If you expand the "Settings"
			and "XFN Relationship" sliders, you can add additional information about your link.</p>
			
			<p>You can	additionally add a "Quick Link", at the top, by entering the URL of your link, and Blogroll
			will attempt to discover information about that URL automatically.</p>
			
			<h3>Manage Blogroll</h3>
			<p>Managing Blogroll Links is done exactly the same as managing standard posts; go to "Manage"
			-&gt; "Blogroll" in the menu. Here you can edit, delete, etc. your Blogroll Links.</p>
			
			<h3>Configure Blogroll</h3>
